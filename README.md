Here is our github for our project

# tigerhacks

An Electron application with React

## Project Setup

The folder setup consists of the server code, which is ran on our Google Cloud virtual machine.

### Install

You must have node.js installed and npm. First  Use the command `npm install` in the root directory of the project.
This will install all packages needed to run the application. Then you may use the `npm run dev` to create a local web
application using Electron framework. A link will also be given to view the website version of the project. Note,
a connection will be made to our Google Cloud virtual machine which connects to our Cluster MongoDB Atlas cluster to store data used in the website.
